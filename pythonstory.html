	<p>This story has you play as a Pizza Hut delivery man who gets caught in an odd adventure that truthfully doesn't make much sense. When creating this, we used simple input commands to make a decision equal to a number. We also used functions to start from a previous "checkpoint" if you made a wrong decision. There is also code that will give the player a game over if they input anything other than what was requested of them. </p>

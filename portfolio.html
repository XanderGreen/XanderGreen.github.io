			<p> This game we made is a game taken place mid battle agaisnt a witch you must defeat through RNG based combat, you select either to use your spells or melee attack by clicking the selected button, programming this mini game-esque battle was difficult in not for reasons that are just constant flaws and errors with the code, rather it was having to create multiple variables and damage calculation values to make it truly random, it originally was going to be a platforming or chase game, but It was decided near last minute hey, let's make it a turn based battle, that'll be fun. So we did. It took  both of us, Alexander Green and Ryan Tucker, to complete it to full extent while I created the sprites and the RNG code, he made the animations and general combat calculations equations.</p>
